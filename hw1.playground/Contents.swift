//: ## Q1: Optionals
class Words {
    var wordA : String!
    var wordB : String!
    
    init (wordA: String?, wordB: String?) {
        self.wordA = wordA
        self.wordB = wordB
    }

//: ### Are the values passed in to the **init** function and those set to the instance
//: ### variables the same type? If not, why?


//: They are different. When the values are passed in they are optionals, but assigning
//: them to the class variable, the optionals are forcefully unwrapped into string objects or nil.


//: ## Q2: Variable Types and Function Types
    class func arePalindromes(words: [String]) -> Bool {
        let reversedWords = words.map() {String($0.characters.reverse())}
        var numElements = words.count
        
        for var i = 0; i < numElements; i++ {
            if words[i] != reversedWords[i] {
                return false
            }
        }
        return true
    }
//: ### Why does the compiler dislike the **for loop**? Fix it.
//: ### What else is wrong with this function? You may have to refer to (but **not**
//: ### change) the code at the very bottom. Debug the function.


//: The compiler doesn't like the for loop because we "let" defines the integer i, making i immutable, 
//: but i needs to be mutable in order to increment, so we use var instead. 
//: Also, this function has to be a class function in order for the user 
//: to call it without creating an instance. This function also needs to 
//: return true outside of the for loop to ensure that in the case that the 
//: if statement isn't satistied, there's still a boolean return value.


//: ## Q3: More Functions and Object Initialization
    func isAnagram() -> Bool {
        var countLetters : [Character : Int] = [Character : Int] () //Line X
        var lenA = wordA.characters.count
        var lenB = wordB.characters.count
        
        if lenA != lenB {
            return false
        }
        
        var arrA = Array(wordA.characters)
        var arrB = Array(wordB.characters)
        
        for i in 0...lenA-1 {
            let letter = arrA[i]
            if let val = countLetters[letter] { //Line Y
                countLetters[letter] = val + 1
            } else {
                countLetters[letter] = 1
            }
        }
        
        for i in 0...lenB-1 {
            let letter = arrB[i]
            if let val = countLetters[letter] {
                countLetters[letter] = val - 1
            } else {
                return false
            }
        }
        
        for (letter, count) in countLetters {
            if count != 0 {
                return false
            }
        }
        
        return true
    }
//: ### What is the problem with declaring **countLetters** as we do in **Line X**,
//: ### and then using it in **Line Y**? Fix it (by only changing **Line X**).
//: ### What else is wrong with this function? You may have to refer to (but **not**
//: ### change) the code at the very bottom. Debug the function.


//: In line X, the original code didn't completely instantiate a dictionary object. 
//: This function needs to be a instance method for the user to call on the instance 
//: "wordsObj". Also, this function is set to return a bool so it cannot return nil.
